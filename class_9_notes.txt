Bower is like npm for client-side libraries

bower install bootstrap

makes bower_components directory by default
touch .bowerrc <- specify where you'd like Bower to install components

{
    "directory" : "client/vendor"
}

pipe | means 'string' in Jade

bower install angular
bower install angular-route <- ngRoute

bower init <- like npm init

controllers get instantiated every time they get used

controllers should be as dumb as possible

npm install body-parser <- for inserting data
